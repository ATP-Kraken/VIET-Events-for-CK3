 HENNA_GLOSS: "#bold Henna#! is a red dye made from the powdered leaves of the henna tree, a plant native to north Africa, Asia, and northern Australia. In the Middle East, North Africa, and India, it has been used since the days of the ancient Egyptians as a body and hair dye. Henna tatoos are still prominent in these regions, and the practice of dyeing one's hair and beard red was widespread historically among men in these regions."
