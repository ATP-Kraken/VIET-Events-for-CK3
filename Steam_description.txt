Very Immersive Events and Tales (VIET), the sequel to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601402546]VIET Events Reborn for CK2[/url], is a flavor mod that adds a vast collection of events about everyday life to spice up your game. They add immersion and a diversity of experiences in between wars and vanilla’s event chains, and cover mundane minutiae from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition. Some events even unlock new decisions, interactions, activities, and much more for you to explore!

I hope the lessons I learned from my years of modding CK2 will help me deliver a fun experience for those who play  my mods, and I hope to add more and more events in every update.

[B][U]VIET WORKS ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Though remember to make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[LIST]
[*]Over [B][U]1128[/U] new flavor events[/B] to experience!
[*]Explore new decisions, artifacts, character interactions, activities, and more!
[*]Game rule to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*][B]Compatible with almost anything[/B] since it doesn't touch any vanilla files - even with overhaul mods, you can via game rule disable events that reference things specific to our medieval world that wouldn’t make sense in other time periods or universes (like fantasy/sci-fi conversion mods)
[*]Learn history with [B]Historical Context tooltips[/B] that provide information about what inspired some of the events - sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction! (These can be disabled via game rule for those who find it immersion breaking.)

[h1]TRANSLATIONS AVAILABLE[/h1]
Because people are kindly spending their own free time and effort to work on these translations, [B]please be aware that the folks working on these translations may or may not be up to date with the latest version of VIET[/B]. Do note that all non-English languages available in the vanilla game has placeholder English localization in the base version of VIET, so they can be safely run, it will just display untranslated text in English (instead of gibberish).

[h1]Version 1.12.3 "Tripitaka"[/h1]

[I]Tripitaka, meaning the “Three Baskets” in Sanskrit, refers to a term used to denote a Buddhist canon that was written down centuries after the life of the historical Buddha. Every major historical and surviving branch of Buddhism has its own collection of canonical texts, which, despite their differences, also have many shared elements.

This update commemorates VIET passing a milestone of 300k subscribers on Steam Workshop – thank you all for your continued support over these many years! My CK modwork has been an unusual but fun way for me to engage in creative writing, and as we get close to the 4th anniversary of VIET for CK3, I hope to continue adding more to the mod in the future.[/I]

New events added in this version: [B]6[/B]

[LIST]
[*]Added 6 events related to the number 3
[*]Tweaked loc for game rules to fit interface
[*]Miscellaneous bugfixes and tweaks
[/LIST]

*Adapted from VIET for CK2

Thanks to all I worked with, took stuff from, and provided me encouragement and feedback over the years. Special thanks in particular to the teams behind WTWSMS (especially IlikeTrains and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining and improving on VIET for CK2 over the years, which provided me a solid foundation for improved reboot of VIET Events. Huge thanks also to the kind souls who take the time to translate the mod and put up with my erratic update schedule.

A few other shoutouts in particular:

[LIST]
[*]Bonseny for the amazing VIET and RICE logos
[*]OrdepNM, my partner in crime in the early days of VIET for CK2 and who stepped up to help maintain it while I had serious medical issues years ago.
[*]Sleight of Hand for pushing me to get into the CK2 modding scene and for other assistance over the years, which is why I am still here for some reason.
[*]tora75 for contributing the Norse unique localizations for several events.
[*]Stik, Vertimnus, and Tobbzn on the CK3 Mod Co-op for helping me figure out how to adapt my CK2 province events and do a system for county events for CK3.
